FineTracker is a simple, lightweight application to track fines, payments, and offender records for organizations such as schools, libraries, or community groups. It provides an easy-to-use interface and a small API for managing fines, generating reports, and recording payments.

> Note: This README was generated by GitHub Copilot — update sections like installation, configuration, and examples to match your project's actual implementation.

## Features

- Create, view, edit, and delete fine records
- Record payments and view payment history
- Search and filter offenders and fines
- Export reports (CSV/JSON)
- Simple REST API for automation and integrations

## Quick start

These instructions assume the repository contains an application written in your preferred language/framework. Replace the commands below with the actual ones for this project.

Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 14 (if a Node app) or the appropriate runtime for your project
- npm or yarn (if applicable)
- Docker (optional)

Local development

1. Clone the repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/syedtayefali369/FineTracker.git
   cd FineTracker
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   # Node.js example
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables

   Copy the example env file and update values:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your database and secret keys
   ```

   Common environment variables

   - `PORT` — server port (default: 3000)
   - `DATABASE_URL` — connection string for the database
   - `JWT_SECRET` — secret for signing authentication tokens

4. Run the application

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser (adjust port if different).

Docker

Build and run with Docker (example):

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t finetracker:latest .

# Run container
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env finetracker:latest
```

API

If the project exposes a REST API, add actual endpoints here. Example:

- GET /api/fines — list fines
- POST /api/fines — create a fine
- GET /api/fines/:id — get fine by id
- POST /api/fines/:id/payments — record a payment

Testing

Run tests using the project's test runner:

```bash
npm test
# or
yarn test
```

Configuration

Describe any configuration files or options, migrations, or initialization steps required to boot the app.

Data migration / Database

If your project requires database migrations, mention the commands to run them. Example:

```bash
# TypeORM / Sequelize / Prisma examples
npm run migrate
```
